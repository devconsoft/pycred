Environmental Variables
=======================
Some settings can be overridden using environmental variables.


PYCRED_CONFIG_FILE
------------------
By default, PyCred will store its main configuration in the pycred package
directory. That can however be overridden using ``PYCRED_CONFIG_FILE``.


PYCRED_STORE_PATH
-----------------
The store configuration directory (``store_path``) is set by the
pycred configuration. It can however, be overriden using ``PYCRED_STORE_PATH``.
